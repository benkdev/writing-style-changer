ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 13), -r requirements.txt (line 18), -r requirements.txt (line 4) and typing_extensions==4.10.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested typing_extensions==4.10.0
    anyio 4.3.0 depends on typing-extensions>=4.1; python_version < "3.11"
    pydantic-core 2.16.3 depends on typing-extensions!=4.7.0 and >=4.6.0
    openai 1.82.0 depends on typing-extensions<5 and >=4.11

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
